# 🌟 Welcome to My CS-499 ePortfolio

Hello! I’m Kristen Hernandez, and this ePortfolio represents the culmination of my work in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University. It showcases my enhanced artifacts, my professional self-assessment, and my growth across the key areas of software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Each project highlights a different dimension of my technical skills and reflects the progression of my abilities throughout the program.

# 💼 Professional Self-Assessment

Throughout my Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have grown into a more confident, versatile, and capable developer. Completing my coursework and building my ePortfolio allowed me to bring together everything I’ve learned—from software engineering and mobile development to data structures, algorithms, and database design—into one cohesive demonstration of my technical abilities. This journey has reinforced my strengths as a problem-solver and validated the dedication, discipline, and attention to detail that I’ve gained through both my academic work and my professional career in the military contracting field. My experience supporting U.S. Navy submarine communication systems taught me how essential reliability, precision, and accountability are in engineering, and these same values have shaped the way I approach software development.

One of the most important lessons I learned during this program was how to collaborate and communicate effectively within technical environments. Many of my projects required coordinating with instructors, interpreting requirements, documenting designs, and explaining solutions clearly for varied audiences. Whether presenting my code review, writing technical narratives, or designing user-friendly interfaces, I learned how to adapt my communication style to meet professional expectations. This skill has been invaluable not only in academics but also in my contractor role, where translating technical details for stakeholders is essential to safe and efficient operations.

Working through multiple languages, tools, and technologies strengthened my adaptability and broadened my technical foundation. I became comfortable designing object-oriented structures in Java, managing state and UI logic in Android Studio, creating efficient algorithmic operations, writing SQL queries and procedures, and building full-stack applications with Node.js, Express, Angular, and MongoDB. Mastering such a wide set of technologies helped me understand how different components interact within complex systems. It also improved my ability to switch between paradigms—console applications, mobile apps, databases, and full-stack development—while meeting deadlines consistently and producing reliable, well-organized code.

Security and defensive programming also became a larger focus for me as I progressed through the program. From validating user input in my software engineering artifact to ensuring relational integrity and automated enforcement rules in my database project, I learned how essential it is to anticipate failure points, protect data, and apply secure coding practices. These experiences deepened my understanding of how real-world systems must be designed with resilience and privacy in mind.

Together, the artifacts in my ePortfolio represent the full range of skills I’ve developed: designing and refactoring software, applying algorithms and data structures to real applications, and building secure, maintainable databases. More importantly, they demonstrate how each area supports the others—how strong design reinforces security, how efficient algorithms improve user experience, and how reliable data systems enable scalability. This combination has prepared me to contribute meaningfully to professional software projects and continue growing as a developer. I’m proud of how far I’ve come, and I’m excited to bring this foundation into my future career.
