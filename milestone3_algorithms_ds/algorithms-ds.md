# 📱 Algorithms & Data Structures Enhancement  
## CS-360 Mobile Inventory App (Android / Java)

### 📌 Overview
This artifact is a redesigned set of components from my mobile inventory application created in CS-360.  
For the enhancement, I focused on implementing algorithmic improvements and improving data handling efficiency.

### 🛠 Enhancements Implemented
- Implemented **sorting** using Java Comparators  
- Added algorithmic **filtering** for low-stock items  
- Introduced UI labels tied to algorithmic results  
- Improved RecyclerView lifecycle handling  
- Ensured predictable, efficient iteration (O(n) and O(n log n))

### 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
- Algorithm design  
- Data structure manipulation (ArrayLists, adapters, model classes)  
- Efficient UI rendering  
- Logical separation of responsibilities  
- Performance-aware coding
